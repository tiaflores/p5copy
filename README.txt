## Discussion

This project was actually really fun despite me wanting to cry constantly

the user interface programming was hard to get used to specifically the
layout of the game itself. The functionality was a whole different monster 
to deal with because it was confusing to know where to put what like the 
action listener for the grid. Any time i had to move something over I had to
change everything and move a million other things around.

Everything breaks all at once help me but it works basically

i want to cry :) but its done so maybe i will 

stream yes or yes
